# Maze Project

## Package requirement 
`pygame`
`seaborn`
`pandas`
`matplotlib`

### How to install the package
1. Go to terminal (`command + space` for **MacOS** | `windows + r` and type `wt` (windows 11 and above) or `cmd` for **Windows**)
2. Type `py -m pip install ...` where `...` is the 4 package that I mension earlier. _The word `py` you can use `python` instead if `py` didn't work_
### How to install the game
You can click on green `Code` button and download as a `ZIP` file or ypu download `git` and clone my project to your computer.

## How to play
- \< up, down, right, left > or \< W, A, S, D> for movement.
- \< r > for information (log information).
- \< space > for shoot
- \< u > for open the statistic mode.
### How to start the game
From the game directory type `py tgame.py` or `py3 tgame.py`

When game start the enemies won't coming to you, you have to move away from you spawn area for start the game. The goal of this game is pass the many level as possible as you can. Further level, more hard its get.

## Apologies
Due to performance issue the player will lag when moving. And in the original PDF I said i will make the further level maze larger, in now game I didn't do that due to performance issue also.
